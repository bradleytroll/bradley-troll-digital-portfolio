        <p>Welcome to my first Portfolio site. It may seem a bit basic right now, but as I progress through Coding Bootcamp, I expect this page to look far more professional. For the past 15 years, I've taught high school English, which has had its up and downs. Now I find myself teaching in a state that seeks to limit access to educational opportunities (and a fair wage for teachers). I'm hoping to transition into the world of coding and web design over the next year. </p>
